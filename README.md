## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+
- npm or yarn
- Python 3.11+
- pip (or uv)
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mehwishahmed/rentvsbuy-ai.git
   cd rentvsbuy-ai
   ```

2. **Install frontend dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a Python virtual environment and install backend dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate        # On Windows use: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   cd ..
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables**
   - Backend (`backend/.env` — this file is ignored by git):
     ```env
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
     ```
     > 🛡️ Keep this file local. Git push protection will block commits if the key is present in history.
   - Frontend (`.env`, optional): override the backend URL if you are not using the default `http://localhost:8000`.
     ```env
     VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
     ```

### Running the app locally

1. **Start the Python backend**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   source .venv/bin/activate        # On Windows use: .venv\Scripts\activate
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
   ```

2. **Start the Vite frontend (new terminal)**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open your browser**
   
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Backend API at a glance

- **App entrypoint:** `backend/app/main.py` (FastAPI)
- **Finance analysis:** `POST /api/finance/analyze`
  - Calculates monthly snapshots, totals, and cost breakdowns
- **AI chat proxy:** `POST /api/ai/chat`
  - Passes chat history to OpenAI when a key is available
  - Gracefully falls back to a local “Mock AI” when no key or an API failure occurs
- **Health check:** `GET /health`

### Troubleshooting

#### "Sorry, I'm having trouble connecting" Error

This error means the frontend can't reach the backend. Follow these steps:

1. **Check if backend is running:**
   - Open a terminal and verify you see: `Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000`
   - If not, start it:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
     uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
     ```

2. **Test backend health:**
   - Open `http://localhost:8000/health` in your browser
   - Should return: `{"status":"ok"}`
   - If it doesn't load, the backend isn't running

3. **Check browser console:**
   - Open DevTools (F12) → Console tab
   - Look for red errors like `Failed to fetch` or `NetworkError`
   - These indicate the frontend can't reach the backend

4. **Verify backend URL:**
   - Check if `.env` file exists in root with:
     ```env
     VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
     ```
   - If missing, create it (or frontend defaults to `http://localhost:8000`)

5. **Check OpenAI API key:**
   - Ensure `backend/.env` exists with:
     ```env
     OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
     ```
   - Without it, backend may fail on AI calls

6. **Verify both terminals are running:**
   - **Terminal 1:** Backend (`uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000`)
   - **Terminal 2:** Frontend (`npm run dev`)

#### Other Common Issues

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Response begins with `(Mock AI)` | Backend is running in fallback mode (no key or API error) | Add/verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `backend/.env` and restart the backend. |
| `Address already in use` when starting backend | Previous `uvicorn` still running | Stop old process (`Ctrl+C` or `pkill -f "uvicorn backend.app.main"`). |
| `Module not found` errors | Dependencies not installed | Run `npm install` (frontend) or `pip install -r requirements.txt` (backend). |
| `Python not found` | Python not installed or not in PATH | Install Python 3.11+ and ensure it's in your PATH. |
| Git push blocked by secret scanning | `.env` accidentally staged | `git reset --soft HEAD~1`, remove `.env` from staging, recommit. |
