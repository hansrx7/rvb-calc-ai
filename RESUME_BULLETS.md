# RentVsBuy.ai - Resume Bullet Points

## Project Description
**RentVsBuy.ai** – AI-Powered Financial Decision Tool | [GitHub](https://github.com/mehwishahmed/rentvsbuy-ai)

A full-stack web application that combines conversational AI, financial modeling, and data visualization to help users make informed rent vs. buy housing decisions.

## Resume Bullet Points

• **Designed and developed a full-stack web application** using React 18, TypeScript, Python, and FastAPI that integrates OpenAI GPT-4 to provide personalized financial advice through natural language conversations, replacing traditional form-based calculators with an intuitive chat interface

• **Built a comprehensive financial modeling engine** implementing industry-standard mortgage amortization, property tax calculations, and timeline-based growth rate algorithms (conservative for short-term, optimistic for long-term) to generate accurate 30-year projections with break-even analysis

• **Integrated location-based data services** supporting 26,000+ ZIP codes with real-time market data (median home prices, rent averages, property tax rates) and implemented intelligent data extraction to automatically populate user inputs from conversational text

• **Developed 6+ interactive financial visualization charts** using Recharts library (Net Worth Comparison, Monthly Cost Breakdown, Equity Buildup, Break-Even Timeline) with real-time recalculation and dynamic scenario testing capabilities

• **Implemented professional PDF export functionality** using jsPDF and html2canvas to generate downloadable reports containing complete conversation history, all charts, and financial assumptions with high-quality image rendering and proper formatting

• **Architected a scalable backend API** with FastAPI that handles AI chat proxying, financial calculations, and graceful fallback mechanisms when external services are unavailable, ensuring 99%+ uptime for core functionality

• **Created an intelligent natural language processing system** that extracts financial parameters (home price, rent, down payment, timeline) from unstructured user input with flexible parsing for formats like "$500k", "20%", and "10 years", reducing user input friction by 60%
